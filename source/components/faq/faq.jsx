			{question: "When should I arrive?", answer: "You should arrive by 5 PM on Friday. A schedule will be released soon. Departure will be at 5 PM Sunday."},
			{question: "What should I bring?", answer: "You should bring a student ID, a change of clothing or two, personal items (toiletries), a laptop & charger, and any required hardware for your project. Essentially, bring anything you would need for a normal weekend. Due to power concerns, please do not bring extra monitors or desktop computers."},
