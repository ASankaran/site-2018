# HackIllinois Site 2018
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HackIllinois/site-2018.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HackIllinois/site-2018)

I'll write a better readme later.

For now, to develop, clone the repository, and then run `npm install`.

Then run `npm run dev` to start a dev server and navigate to localhost:8080.

Cheers.
